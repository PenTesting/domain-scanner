> A node utility to scan a domain with various techniques.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install --save domain-scanner
```

## Usage
The usage is simple, just pass to the scanner the domain you want to scan and some options, than wait for the response:
```js
const domainScanner = require('domain-scanner');

const options = {
  section: [],
  keys: {}
};

domainScanner('Rainbow', options, (err, results) => {
  console.log(results);
});
```

## Options
#### sections
An array with the names of the sections you want to scan, leave empty to scan all sections. Available sections are:
* __details__: Will perform some system based evaluations against the domain.
* __emails__: Will scan the domain looking for known emails with [node-emailhunter](https://github.com/b4dnewz/node-emailhunter)
* __robots__: Will scan the domain robots.txt file with [robots-parse](https://github.com/b4dnewz/robots-parse)

```js
const options = {
  sections: ['details', 'robots']
};
```

#### keys
An object with the API keys for the services involved in the scan. For example to use [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io/) API:
```js
const options = {
  keys: {
    hunterio: '<some-api-key>'
  }
};
```
